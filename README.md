# ML---Model-building

To solve the below given problem:

A project with an ecommerce company based in london sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile pp or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've asked to help them figure it out.

We worked eith the ecommerce csv file from the company. It has numerical columns:
1) Avg. session length: Avg session of in-store style advice sessions.
2) Time on App: Avg time spent on App in minutes.
3) Time on website: Avg time spent on website in minutes.
4) Length of membership: How many yearsthe customer has been a member.
5) Yearly amount spent: The total amount the customer is spending.

BUSINESS PROBLEM : Interpret which variables are contributing towards the more annual income prediction.
